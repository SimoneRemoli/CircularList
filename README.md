The software shows an example of connection and disconnection between nodes of a simple list. What makes the program complicated is the ability to correctly manage the saving of the memory areas of the pointers necessary for connecting and disconnecting the nodes.

<h3 align="center"> Let's look at how it works. :mag:</h3> 


### Execute :computer:
Copy the folder inside your local device and open it with the terminal.  Operation requires that only 5 nodes be managed and the order be exchanged between them every time a new acquisition is made from standard input (stdin). Let's consider an example next.

## Source execution example :bulb:
Initially, up to a maximum of five nodes will be created. An **array** will store the **link information** of these nodes.
Remember that in an abstract way, a node is composed of the **actual information content and a memory address** that points to the next node.
